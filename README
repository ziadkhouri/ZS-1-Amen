-DESCRIPTION-
Amen has been designed so simplify the process of rearranging waveforms.
Once loaded, a waveform can be rearranged using the sequence editor (at
the bottom of the dialog window) or using the sequence generator. The 
coloured boxes of the sequence editor correspond to the coloured lines
on the waveform display. These represent offsets from which the sample 
can be triggered and left to loop naturally. These offsets can be
selected and repositioned using the mouse. Using the right mousebutton
will instruct the program to find the closest onset to the point where
the mousebutton was released. This is done using the volume envelope 
superimposed in front of the waveform. The window size of this envelope
can be changed.

Unfortunately there is no other on-line help at this stage.
